      <li><strong>re-introduce <a href="https://github.com/ho-dev/HattrickOrganizer/wiki/FeedBack">User Feedback</a> in order to allow among other things prediction rating improvement #38 #131</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Formulas will not use anymore the stars but absolutes and relatives players evaluation‚Äôs value #212</strong></li>
      <li>In squad and Lineup, are calculated both the absolute and the relative contribution of a player to the ratings</li>
      <li>The absolute is more or less what would be the sum of his contribution to the 7 sectors</li>
      <li>The relative contribution helps to determine the best position for a given player. It is the absolute contribution corrected by a factor. This allows to account for that some position contribute more to the total ratings than others (e.g. a player being divine in all his carac will contribute more to ratings if positioned as MidField than if positioned as WB)</li>
      <li>The coeffs are calculated using the prediction parameters of HO. They are approximate but hopefully they would be improved if we got sufficient contribution from the newly introduce FeedBack plugin.</li>

<h1>Changelist HO! 1.432</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Hattrick Organizer now requires Java 1.6 (aka JRE6). Open JDK supports older operating systems that oracle does not. Please update your Java installation if needed.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Player subskills<br/>. Training is now minute based. Correct counting only for matches downloaded in 1.431 or later.<br/> It is possible to delete your own matches by the db cleanup tool, and download them again by<br/> archive options in download. After this a full subskill recalculation could be interesting.<br/>. Osmosis training has been added. A small training effect for all players on the field.<br/>. Added green background for 100% trainees and yellow for 50% trainees in training prediction (white background for osmosis training).<br/>. Use subskill overflow for training prediction to avoid rounding errors hiding coach and assitant number changes effects.<br/>. The skill level effect on training has been adjusted.<br/>. Skill drops due to age at 30 or above, or at skills of 16 or above is in as a first version.<br/> Speeds will require more or less tuning.<br/>. Training offset has been removed, and been replaced with an option to adjust the subskill directly.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Team Analyzer<br/>. All update restrictions have been removed, including favorite teams.<br/>. Update will now download the matches to fill out your autofilter request, or the 30 last opponent matches if a manual filter is selected.<br/>. Tournament opponents are in, and so are tournament matches.<br/>. Auto filter options are now saved when you analyze, and should reappear that way until changed.<br/>. Auto filter options for tournament and masters matches.<br/>. Fixed bug that renaming team after the last league match prevented analyzing matches before name changes.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Match order uploads<br/>. The option to upload match orders to Hattrick have been added.<br/>. This is a Hattrick supporter feature, and non-supporters will find the upload button inactive.<br/>. The lineup tab now has its own tabs, the new ones are:<br/> . Lineup - the old one.<br/> . Match orders - a place to set and view match orders.<br/> . Penalty takers - a place to view and set the penalty shooter list.<br/> . Upload/Download - a place to upload and download orders to and from specific matches.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Special Events<br/>. got a lot of improvments (esp. the filter)</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Lazy initialization/refresh<br/>. The content of each tab is now loaded not before the tab is opened for the first time. Analogous,<br/> if the content of a tab needs to be refreshed, it is only refreshed if the tab is currently showing.<br/> If it's not showing, it will be refreshed as soon as it gets shown. This works (at the moment) for<br/> all tabs except lineup, players, transfers. Lazy initialization/refresh will noticeable (depending<br/> on the number of modules you are using) decrease startup time and reduce the memory footprint of the application.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Added Tournament matches.</p></li>
  <li>New icon and startup screen.</li>
  <li>Moved intern help texts and from external files to our wiki page (https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ho1/wiki/Manual) and link to it in the menu.</li>
  <li>Made player name column width adjustable on squad tab.</li>
  <li>Added half time results in matches tab.</li>
  <li>Seat distribution is shown in arena section of Statistics tab.</li>
  <li>Stadium prices HT-adapted (7/10/19/35).</li>
  <li>Copying ratings to the clipboard in HT-ML table format now centres all ratings in the table.</li>
  <li>Lowered Overcrowding penalty for lineups with 3 forwards. Attack ratings with 3 forwards should now be closer to the reality.</li>
  <li>TS Forecast Module should now display confidence at the correct level.</li>
  <li>TS Forecast Module: Fixed Loepi curve with a new database, enabled TS and confidence graphs by default and detect if team is still in cup or has qualifiers.</li>
  <li>Maintain Captain and Set piece taker when the line up is reversed.</li>
  <li>The old penalty shooter button is gone. Look for the new tab instead.</li>
  <li>Added ability to reset all positional orders in the line up tab.</li>
  <li>Calculate loyalty and homegrownbonus for set pieces and penalty takers.</li>
  <li>Fixed IFA module not to download matches before the user got the team.</li>
  <li>Removed Shirt number 100 for players without a shirt number.</li>
  <li>Included Loyalty and mother club into csv player export</li>
  <li>ArenaStats initial view corrected (filter setting was "competition matches", while what was displayed was "all matches").</li>
  <li>on HRF import, user will not be asked for every HRF which was already imported if he wants to import it again (checkbox "apply to all")</li>
  <li>user/database configuration form got some polish and went from the Options dialog to the File-&gt;Database menu</li>
  <li>database cleanup tool went from the Tools menu to File-&gt;Database</li>

<h2>Special Notes:</h2>
<p>HO 1.400 includes a first version to predict the ratings of the new match engine. The quality proved to be quite good at internal tests, but the differences may be a bit higher than for the old engine. Use the prediction offset calculation to get better results and provide feedback in the HO! forum. That way we can enhance the accuracy. Thx!</p>
<p>The 2 most active HO1 developers from the lasst months are on vacation for the next 2 respectively 3 weeks. Thats not planned, but a funny coincidence. It might get a bit silent from HO! side during this time. We expect to have helpful feedback when we're back - especially regardings the new rating predictions.</p>

<p>Special Note 1:<br/> ---------------<br/> To those who did not notice yet: with the help of our fellow user Odicin we<br/> were able to fix the 3rd party plugins "International Friendly Analyzer" and<br/> "Flags plugin". Both plugins stopped working after the HT/CHPP change last<br/> November. If you use these plugins and have problems with the update of new<br/> flags, make sure to have the latest version installed.<br/> Check this menu: File -&gt; Update -&gt; Plugins -&gt; Normal.</p>
<p>Special Note 2:<br/> ---------------<br/> Thanks to the work of two HO! users Yusuf and Pablo we can offer "Turkish"<br/> and "Galician(Galego)" as new HO! language soon. Unfortunately both didn't<br/> make it into HO! 1.398, we're very sorry! But in the next days both should<br/> be available using the HO! update for language files.</p>
