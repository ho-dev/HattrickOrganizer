Contributing to HO
=========================

Whether you are a novice or experienced software developer, all contributions and suggestions are welcome! If you are looking to contribute to the HO codebase, the best place to start is the GitHub "issues" tab. This is also a great place for filing bug reports and making suggestions for ways in which we can improve the code and documentation.

Filing Issues
------------------------

If you notice a bug in the code or in docs or have suggestions for how we can improve either, feel free to create an issue or a feature request on the GitHub "issues" tab using prefilled form. Those form contains some questions that will help us best address your issue.

Getting Started
--------------------

The code is hosted on GitHub, so you will need to use Git to clone the project and make changes to the 
codebase. It is also suggested to use IntelliJ IDEA as the main IDE. In case you decide to use 
Eclipse make sure to add all the relevant filters in the .ignore accordingly.

In case of problems to set the development environment up, please consult our :ref:`faq` page to see 
the list of the most common issues.

Contributing to the Codebase
---------------------------------

In case you are not familiar with project contribution on GitHub, we suggest you read first some 
appropriate `documentation <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_. 

Before submitting your changes for review, make sure to pull latest version of master and check that 
HO builds with your changes. Once your changes are ready to be submitted, make sure to push your 
changes to GitHub before creating a pull request. You will most likely be asked to make additional 
changes before it is finally ready to merge. However, once it's ready, we will merge it, and you will 
have successfully contributed to the codebase!

Translations
-----------------------------
You can simply do so via `PoEditor <https://poeditor.com/join/project/jCaWGL1JCl>`_

You need to fix both 'Fuzzy translation' (priority) and remaining untranslated terms. 
In case the language in which you would like to contribute is not listed in the project page 
please make a request by opening a ticket on GitHub
