## Localization

If you want to contribute or see current translation status please visit HO translation [website](https://poeditor.com/join/project/jCaWGL1JCl).   
Please open a request if the language you are interested in is not listed.

## Development workflow

A single master branch record the history of the project.

To contribute features, you should clone the repository, create a tracking branch for develop and create the feature.
When the feature is ready, you can make a pull request to merge that feature into master. 
Please read the [contribution guide](contributing.md) first.
