/**
 * Instances of this Gif89Frame subclass are constructed from bitmaps in the
 * form of color-index pixels, which accords with a GIF's native palettized
 * color model. The class is useful when complete control over a GIF's color
 * palette is desired. It is also much more efficient when one is using an
 * algorithmic frame generator that isn't interested in RGB values (such as a
 * cellular automaton).
 * <p>
 * Objects of this class are normally added to a Gif89Encoder object that has
 * been provided with an explicit color table at construction. While you may
 * also add them to "auto-map" encoders without an exception being thrown, there
 * obviously must be at least one DirectGif89Frame object in the sequence so
 * that a color table may be detected.
