Bugfixes
========
P D Bug description
------------------------------------------------------
1 ? HO misses training for player of either the friendly or the league match
	Reason (probably): if the user downloads data right after a match seems finished,
			it was actually not really finished on HT (no cards/goals visible at players,...).
			HO got no valid XML (in progress), but the match short info incl. the result was available.
			HO seems not to load this matchs data upon the next connection in such cases and
			it will be missing at the training calculation.
2 F Subskills are gone after a correct HO update (while keeping the DB) or a SubSkill-Recalc for some users
	Reason (probably): The problem seems to exist only, if some training weeks are missing in the DB
			(i.e. the user forgot to download the .HRF of some weeks)
			Maybe a problem of TrainingsManager.calculateFullTrainingForPlayer() because
			TrainingsManager.calculateWeeklyTrainingForPlayer() works fine...
2 ? Fix training length calculation on substitute players
			Currently the necessary data are not in the XMLs (and not annouces either)
2 ? Hattrick data is not downloaded properly when the HO homepage is down and HO check is activated
	Note(by aik): we can easily fix this by using timeouts at the URLConnection there (i implemented it once),
			but this is only possible since JDK 1.5 - our current code is JDK 1.4 compatible. Either
			we move to >1.5 or we need to build something like an own timout checker thread.
3 A NPE in Aufstellung.getLeftAttackRating():535, maybe because of special lineups (like 4-4-1)
	We need an affected DB to further examine the problem
3 ? Klicking through many different matches (50+) in the "Matches" tab slows down HO til it becomes unusable
	Reason: StackOverflowError (we don't know the exact code point, yet)
			Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.StackOverflowError
			at sun.awt.image.ImageWatched$WeakLink.isWatcher(ImageWatched.java:84)
			...
			at sun.awt.image.ImageWatched$WeakLink.isWatcher(ImageWatched.java:84)
			(message repeats several thousand times...)
3 ? TA doesn't show up after successful installation
3 ? IFA doesn't show up after successful installation
3 A Large memory consumption at the training update crashes / blocks some HO installations
    	Removing old matches and giving HO more heap memory 'solves' this issue
4 ? Add string and icon for regainer
4 A Sorting by matchday in TA matchlist is buggy (1, 10, 11, 2, 3, ..)
5 ? Remove/hide unneccessary doubled columns from PlayerOverview/Lineup (name & shirtnumber are shown 2 times)
5 F Adding a prediction offset for a certain skill can lead to a lower(!) star value
	Reason: Skills<=7 with subskill==offset==0 will be calculated with subskill=0.5...
			If such a player gets training or a manual offset < 0.5, the star value decreases...
			Perhaps we should change that...
5 A IFA-Plugin: some generated logos get a black background instead of the correct one
5 ? Transferscout cannot parse players with special characters (e.g. from China or Cambodia)
5 ? Transfers: the level of some skills is not visible, if the skill name is long,
		Example: German "Chancenverwertu.." instead of English "Scoring (12)"
5 ? MySQL error messages, as reported here:
		http://forum.hattrickorganizer.net/index.php?page=Thread&postID=4896#post4896
5 ? Wrong formation in Matches overview plugin, e.g. "3-3-3" instead of "3-4-3"


Enhancements
============
P D Task
------------------------------------------------------
3 ? Training calculation is VERY slow, we need to speed this up if possible
	I think re-implemeting the whole training calculation would make the most sense :-/
3 ? Use a less intrusive wait window / progress bar (do not force the window in front of all other windows)
4 ? Add brown stars (player performance at the end of the game) to HO
	a. Download them from HT (CHPP in the new season [Germany, S. 37] should make this possible)
	b. Put them it the HO-DB
	c. Show them to the user
	d. Predict yellow/brown stars separately (?)
4 F Add (better) tactic strength prediction for Longshots
4 A Add handling and match event symbol for Longshots even 188/288 (combined with pressing?)
5 ? Automatically set the "Away derby" option in the lineup tab, if the next match is such a game
5 ? Add player agreeability to TransferScout
5 F Add a debug level option to HO.sh or - even better - to HO's config options
5 A Add some more parameters to the XML exporter plugin (export matches with injured players etc.)
5 ? User request: add predicted rating effects to the skilltester. Add a combobox, where the position (i.e. WBdef)
	gets selected and the HO shows values like "side def +1.13", "central def +0.56", "midfield +0.05" etc.
5 ? TrainingExperience: add players age (inc. days) and market value at skillup time as tooltip to the prediction tab
5 ? Add stats (HT, Loddar, Squad, etc.) to the matches view
5 ? Add button to start the match simulation from the matches tab (with ratings and special tactic from this 'old' match)
5 ? Show opponent statistics (probably at TeamAnalyzer): HT, Loddar, average form, injured players, TSI sum/average
5 D Transferscout: add button to remove all player with one single klick
5 ? Enhance visualization in Georgian mode: use another font + use Georgian font in dialog titles
5 ? Add symbol to players view and TrainingExperience view, if there is an active training block (individual instruction) set
5 ? Improve healing tool prediction
5 ? Improve visuability of 5-, 10- and 50-stars
5 ? Save (and restore) user defined table order in TrainingExperience plugin


Features
========
P D Task
------------------------------------------------------
4 A HO! version for U3-USB stick
4 A Add connection test utility
5 ? Add optional(!) delayed training popup (like Hattrick Buddy)
5 A Add tool to automatically create HRF files with data from National Team players (for NTs only)
4 ? Show seat distribution in stadium stats


Fixed/Resolved
==============
P D Task
------------------------------------------------------
2 F Training speed is wrong in some rare cases: from 0.11 to 0.03 whithin a week without any reason
	(same training type, no injury, no card, no 50% training position, same age)
	Reason: player would have reached subskill >1 which gets reduced to 0.94 by HO
		Perhaps we should change that too ^^
2 A Transferscout parser adds injuries, if a player is warned (red card)
2 D Tactic strength is wrong after loading a lineup with a configured tactic type
	Same problem exists after starting HO, when a lineup with a tactic is set or loaded from HT.
2 F Update calculation of special tactics after the latest playerstrength optimisations
3 F Optimize EPV
3 F Set 2 fraction digits by default (because we have set maxSubskill from 0.94 to 0.99 now)
3 F Remove dependency of HO1 project to hoplugins.Commons - HO itself should not depend on any plugin
	(this breaks the build process for new dev environments)
3 A A long teamname confuses the layout of the simulation window (TA) so that many values become unreadable
3 A Add indirect freekicks to match highlights
		Status: implementation needs to be tested (do we handle all events?)
4 F Attack rating prediction of normal/off midfielder looks odd.
	An IM produces less attack rating when playing offensive than playing normal.
	Fixed by the new optimization.
4 F Players training progress in the TrainingExperience tab seems wrong
		the bar charts don't match to the subskills on the player overview
4 F Apply some GUI changes to make subskill > 0.94 look better with fraction digits<2
4 A Reactivate auto update function (adjust SF links!)
4 A The old youth school is excellent and in HO, in Misc tab there is passable youth school
	Reason: bug from HT, many/all old youth systems are level 6 now. Notified CHPPs.
	09.01.2009: Fixed according to HT-Thomas (it was an HT bug anyway)
4 F Fix HO.sh for linux (accept whitespaces in path name)
4 D Add a new config option for the default state of the "download matches/schedule" checkboxes on the download dialog
4 D Squad Overview: Columns 'salary' and 'market value' were too small after db is generated
4 F Implement a SpeedUpTool that automatically removes old HRFs and matches (configurable)
4 A If the first download after a stadium expansion includes also a new match, the old
    stadium size is shown in statistics. One can get >100% usage then.
5 A Add handling and match event symbol for Longshots even 187/287
5 F Create a windows installer package to improve n00b compatibility ;-)
	We are using NSIS unicode for a windows installer now, yeah! :-)
5 A Show weather SEs in match highlights
5 F Update ExperienceViewer-Plugin (0.51) and Spieler.getErfahrungBonus()
5 F Add an individual player training block (i.e. don't count skill training for a specific player)
	(with start date, so that recalc subskills does still work for older trainings)
5 F Add a soft time limit to HO (show a notice if the HO version is older than x months, but start HO anyway)
5 F Add a player export function (CSV)
5 A Teamanalyzer: it's not possible to start the simulation, if the tactic level is above divine
5 D Fixed: Saving lineup allows to use the reserved words "last lineup"
