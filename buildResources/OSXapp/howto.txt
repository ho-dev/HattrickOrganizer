In 2394 a new .dmg was committed. Then updated a few revisions later. This is how to make them.

Run linux...

A couple of hfs packages are needed. They are complained about if you try without.

Create the image. The first creates it, and the count 15 is the number of megabytes. The second
line formats it to mac preferences.

dd if=/dev/zero of=HO.dmg bs=1M count=15
mkfs.hfsplus -v HO HO.dmg

This mounts a .dmg to an existing folder:

mount -o loop -t hfsplus HO.dmg /path/to/directory/you/want

There are some installer structures in the images that may be necessary (not tried without).
To copy them across, mount the old and new to separate folders, and copy (-r) the contents across.
